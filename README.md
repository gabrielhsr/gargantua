# Gargantua

Gargantua is an application that I'm creating so that my wife and I can manage our finances together.

The objective is that we have access via browser and see our financial situation instantly. Today this is already partially accomplished by Excel spreadsheets, but it's no longer serving.

The application's name is based on the black hole from the movie Interstellar. It's a movie that we both really like.
